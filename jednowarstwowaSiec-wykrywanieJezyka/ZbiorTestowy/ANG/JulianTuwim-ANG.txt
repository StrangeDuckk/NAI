A Poem in Which the Author Politely but Firmly
Asks Numerous Fellow Humans to Kiss His Ass

The suitors of Fat Bertha,
And the coal miners of Katowice,
And the oil drillers of Borysław,
And the bourgeois of Łódź, burly lads.
Warsaw dandies, gigolos,
In a gang with refined ladies,
Ruffians, scoundrels, brawlers,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

Israelite doctors,
Offshoots of Vienna, the Jewish Mecca,
Who spread cultured syphilis
In Bochnia, Stryj, and Kraków;
You who slurp your intellectual soup
From the pages of "Naje Fraje,"
Scholars, well-read gentlemen,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

And also you, Aryan experts,
Farts of the Germanic spirit
(When I check your blood and mine,
Believe me – it will be the same muck).
Obedient lackeys and stormtroopers,
Heroes of Maccabi or Owupe,
Record-breakers and athletes,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

Dull and gloomy socialists,
Pedants, neo-Catholics,
Those who prance around culture,
Worshippers of radio and physics,
Learned apes, precise scientists,
Who view the world through a magnifying glass,
And know everything: what, how, when,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

And also that girls’ school teacher,
Who would love to but simply can't,
And Professor Cy… from Vilnius
(You already know why, Professor!).
And you, old hag, left unsatisfied in youth,
Who dares to sic your puppies on me,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

And you, you filthy rich bastard,
Perfumed little brat,
Who wears the splendor and spleen of London
On your pretentious face,
And you, who live in a palace now,
But used to shit behind a shack,
You, fattened up on Ikac,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

And also the Zionists of Palestine,
Halutzim, who tenderly shed
Ancient Jewish idiot tears,
Because "the fir trees whisper in Tel Aviv,"
And all the pan-Slavic dreamers,
Gathered in a picturesque troupe,
With any mystical fool as their leader,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

And also chatterboxes and babblers,
Leeching fat pensions from heaven,
Oh, quacks of Jasna Góra,
And holy boils of Kalwaria,
And you, little priest, who has
Your dick tied up in a knot,
So it won’t prance around,
Kiss my ass, all of you.

And all of you whom I forgot,
Or skipped out of mercy,
Or because I was afraid,
Or because there are just too many of you,
And you, censor, who for this poem
Will likely throw me in jail,
And for making me the leader of perverts,
Kiss my ass, all of you!
